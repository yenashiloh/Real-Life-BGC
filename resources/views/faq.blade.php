                What does Real LIFE provide for its scholars?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Real LIFE helps scholars finish their education by covering their tuition and miscellaneous fees,
                school-related expenses, and weekly allowances. Real LIFE also prepares its scholars for life by
                providing character formation and leadership development programs.

                    <li>If a high school student, must be enrolled in a school that offers free tuition or has DepEd
                        voucher

                    <li>If a college student, must be enrolled in a state university or a private school that charges

                I’m a college student and my tuition fees are beyond 20,000 PHP. Does this mean I can’t apply
                anymore?
            </div>

                To be eligible to receive the Real LIFE scholarship, applicants must:
                You may still apply for a Real LIFE scholarship if your school grants you an academic scholarship
                that will cover your tuition fees until graduation. If you are accepted into the Real LIFE
                scholarship program, your weekly allowance and other school-related expenses will be covered by Real
                LIFE.

                What is the application process and how long does it take?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">The first stage of the application process is a paper screening
                    where our local center teams review all the application forms and make a shortlist of those who
                    will move on to the next stage.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">The second stage is a panel screening or interview where our local
                    center teams meet with applicants to know them more. Victory pastors, psychologists, social
                    workers, and Every Nation Campus missionaries are also invited to join the panel screening.
                    After this, the local center teams will make another shortlist of those who are qualified to
                    proceed to the next stage.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">The third stage is a home visit for each applicant. This is
                    conducted to verify the information given by applicants in their application forms and panel
                    screenings. This is also an opportunity for our local center teams to meet the applicants'
                    families and explain the scholarship program to them. We value home visits because we want to
                    build partnerships with the families of our scholars and know how we can provide the best
                    support to their children. After the home visits, the local center teams will send the final
                    list of recommended applicants to the Real LIFE national office.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Once all local center teams have submitted their recommendations,
                    the scholarship team at the Real LIFE national office will deliberate and select the applicants
                    who will be accepted into the program.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">After the final deliberation, chosen applicants will receive a
                    letter from the Real LIFE national office, confirming their acceptance into the scholarship
                    program.</li>

                Does Real LIFE accept applicants in the middle of the school year?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Since Real LIFE grants scholarships per school year instead of per semester, we do not accept
                applicants in the middle of the school year.
